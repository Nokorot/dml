- option to change the separarotr from space, or another way to allow spaces in the key

- %include %ENV_VAR

- For the %if, there might be usefull to specify, how to compute the condition,
    since the current stuff it into bash, is likely quite slow in a lot of simple cases

- For example, could implement, -[zn] $ENV_VAR directly.
       -e file True if file exists.
       -p program  True if program is running. 
                (Don't know if it is better the n pgrep)
       -x cmd  command cmd is defined 

       -z string True if the length of string is zero.
       -n string True if the length of string is non-zero.
       string1 == string2
       string1 = string2
              True  if the strings are equal.  = should be used with the test
              command for POSIX conformance.  When used with the [[  command,
              this  performs  pattern  matching  as described above (Compound
              Commands).

       string1 != string2
              True if the strings are not equal.

       string1 < string2
              True if string1 sorts before string2 lexicographically.

       string1 > string2
              True if string1 sorts after string2 lexicographically.



- %check, %otherwise 

- %variables


# Kinda works
    - %if blocks. Could replace the %check maybe
    - like the result of some command, 
    - pgrep i3 >/dev/null  ## Is i3 running
    - $ENV_VAR defined
